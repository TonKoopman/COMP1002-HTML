        <hr>
        <h2>Jacob Hodges</h2>

        <p>
            I am a first year college student at georgian college. I am studying computer programming. <br>
            I love making little games on my own for fun, I am a very musical person, and finally I love <br>
            scuba diving. I'm self taught in guitar, piano, tenor saxaphone, etc and am better than a lot <br>
            of people would think for someone who is self taught. 
        </p>

        <p>
            My goals for college and my career are to have high grades and a successful job after I graduate. <br>
            I would like to completely finish the game I am making and publish it by the summer of 2024. <br>
            I would like to have a job as a game developer but expect to be doing some sort of software <br>
            engineering after college.
        </p>
